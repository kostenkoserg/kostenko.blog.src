    My name is Sergii Kostenko. I am a senior software engeneer living in Kiev. I worked in IT from 2004 on different positions with different stacks.
    The most experience I have in Java SE and Java EE. Last one is my favorite set of specifications. I am familiar with different JEE application
    servers like Wildfly, Payara, WebSphere, Weblogic and closely follow last EE trends like microprofiles, microservices and cloud oriented architecture.
    The same time I am always open for something new and interested.
    <br/>
    I belive in Open Source and trust that Open Source did IT great and fun and will do it again and again :)
    <br/><br/>
