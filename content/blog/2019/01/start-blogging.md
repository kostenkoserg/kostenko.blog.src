I wanted to start a my own tech blog long ago. But by different reasons have started only now. First i wanted to do own blog engine, after spent lot of time to searching for nice look and feel  and  then sorting out popular solutions like wordpres, wix, blogger etc...

After all i found [pages.github.io](https://pages.github.com/) with their static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Last one looks good from different points of view. It is simple, it is for free, it is quick enough, it is stable.  Finally if GitHub it is a pretty nice place for work with source code why it can't be the same for a blog source ?

While investigating Jekyll (written on Rubby), i found  JVM based Jekyll analog - project [JBake](https://jbake.org/). Ðžf course last one seemed to me most closer.

So, decision is made. Let's go!
